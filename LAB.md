## Description

For this assignment, rewrite your [`http-single-resource` assignment](../../../http-single-resource/blob/master/LAB.md)
using ExpressJS.

Go ahead and cut and paste your data storage module(s) into this project (or publish it on npm!), you shouldn't
need to rewrite those!

You API E2E tests should also be usable "as-is". Though correctness trumps re-use.

All requirements are still in play.

## Bonus

Create static files and/or rendered templates that allow you to exercise your API: 5pts

#### Rubric:
